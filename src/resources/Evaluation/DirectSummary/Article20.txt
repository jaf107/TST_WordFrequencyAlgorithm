How Autumn is Personified in keats' To Autumn'
Personification is a figure of speech in which the attributes of a person are transferred to inanimate objects or abstract ideas.
In other words, in this figure of speech inanimate objects and abstract ideas or qualities are spoken of as if they are persons or human being.
Keats has used a number of imageries to give the autumn a concrete shape of a person.
Autumn has made a conspiracy or agreement with the sun ‘to load and bless’ the vines and frees with ‘grapes and apples’, and also to ripen all fruits to the ‘core’.
So, in the first stanza autumn is seen to be an active person who is dutiful and enjoys his work very much.
Here autumn is in the form of a rural peasant woman, who is busy during the harvest.
Autumn, at first is seen as a woman doing the work of winnowing that is separating the chaff from the grain.
She is careless because she is not afraid of the future as she has harvested abundant crops this year.
Secondly autumn is personified as a solitary reaper, who in course of her work is so overcome by the sleep inducing smell of poppies and falls asleep, with the result that the next row of corn remains unreaped.
A gleaner is a woman who collects grains from the field when the crops have been removed.
A gleaner may be seen walking along steadily with the weight of grains upon her head, crossing a stream.
Finally, autumn is given the personality of a cider presser, who sits by the cider press and watches patiently the apple juice flowing out of the press drop by drop.
Autumn is seen to be as an unhappy man, because he is deprived of the beauties of spring.
But the poet consoles the season, saying that it has its own songs which are no less individualistic.
