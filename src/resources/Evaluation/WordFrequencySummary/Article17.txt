My love for radio resurfaced during my youth when I was studying at Cambridge.  Why do I love radio so much? I can close my eyes and concentrate.  BBC World Service, Voice of America, All India Radio, Radio Ceylon, Radio Luxembourg, Australian Broadcasting; the list goes on.  BBC Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4, Radio 5, and World Service all had something for every mood and every occasion.  The Guardian, UK launched the world's first podcast in 2004.  Just like social media is today's portal to a virtual world.  After studies, reading books, listening to music or following the radio was what you could do.  Audio attracted me much more than the world of ink and paper. 

The radio channel was Bangladesh Betar (then Radio Bangladesh) and its different stations.  I spent endless nights listening to music or the radio.  There would be a special Yesterday Once More on Tuesdays that featured music from the 1960s and 1970s, my signature decades when it comes to music.  The cassette player and the radio was my portal to an imaginary world.  Soon, NPR (National Public Radio) of the USA started providing texts with their programmes.  I spent my initial childhood (1974-1979) in Aberystwyth in Wales, UK, in a beautiful sea-side university town, where my father was studying.  By the time, I was prepared to read, a second twist came.  I had limited exposure to television, but BBC Radio would play in the background. 

After my SSC in 1985, my parents gifted me a National Panasonic music system. My listening ability developed better than my reading ability due to circumstances in life.  Thus began my journey with audio, through music and radio.  There was a Bangla cinema songs programme that exposed me to our master composer Alauddin Ali Shaheb and others.  It was in my Cambridge days I realised how beautiful BBC Radio was.
