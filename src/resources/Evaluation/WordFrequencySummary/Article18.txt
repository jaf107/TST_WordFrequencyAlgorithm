 I started buying books in bulk, reading only half of them at the best of times, forgetting the rest within a few months.  These will not even go through our working memory to become long-term, let alone leave behind an impact reading usually entails.  It wasn't till a year and half passed that I realised that even though I had read more books in those months than ever, I had retained the least.  Ever since I was a little girl, I would get two or three books a month, and I'd voraciously read through every word, remembering everything to my heart's content.  The thought of connecting with readers from every corner of the world seemed hearty, so I joined various readers' groups.  It is better to read a book every month and be able to retain the contents for long than to read five books a month and wonder what they were even about after a year.  Whilst profuse reading is seemingly romantic, nothing should occupy the life of an individual to the point where it does more harm than good.  Thus, complicating it further by attaching superficial goals to it is a superfluous attempt to challenge oneself.  As a reader, one should not feel inadequate for having read fewer books than another person. 

There is no denying that there are readers who can readily extract said pleasure even through reading goals, but I find it rather counterproductive and diminutive when it comes to attaining the actual essence of reading.  That is when I came across the concept of reading goals, and it was almost as if I was never a reader at all, a thought that hit hard given I always thought of myself as a good reader, if nothing else.
