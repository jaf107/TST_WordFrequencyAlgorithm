Try the "five, four, three, two, one" technique to relax: Look around you and name them aloud as you notice them: five things you can see, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste. 

It is more effective to identify what need - physical, emotional, intellectual or spiritual - is most pressing and try one technique at a time to gauge if it helps you. "

Dr Chow said seniors, children, caregivers, front-line workers, those who are living alone or socially isolated, and those who already struggle with depression and anxiety have an increased risk of getting pandemic fatigue. 

As a result, the 24-year-old, who is doing a communications degree from the University at Buffalo at the Singapore Institute of Management, said he feels "pressured to work harder".  "I'm doing unpaid writing work to beef up my resume so it'll help in my job hunt," said Sng, who is an only child. 

Habituation - the progressive decrease in response, such as feelings of anxiety, after repeated exposure to a stimulus - has caused people to become less careful or conscious about the precautions they need to take than they were at the start of the pandemic, said Chen. 

"But when the circuit breaker was extended and subsequent announcements about phase one and phase two were made, it was hard for people to keep up, and even more so with no clear end in sight. 

"Pandemic fatigue describes a mental state where a prolonged, heightened state of fear and caution leads to a form of burnout.  I've put on 5kg since the circuit breaker and I don't want people to see me looking like a mess at home.  The breaks they used to take overseas are now non-existent and the work they do has taken a radical shift for some, especially if they are working from home," she said. 

"Everyone was required to adapt in a short amount of time and many people were accepting of these restrictions as they thought it was a short-term measure to deal with the virus," said Chen, who is head of psychology at NUH. 

Chen advised people to seek help from a psychologist if they experience persistent anxiety, hopelessness or sadness for more than two weeks, which in turn affects their performance and relationships.  For instance, you can travel vicariously with friends by having a "watch party" of a travel show and make a fantasy list of future travel plans together. 

His 55-year-old mother was retrenched from a part-time job as a food promoter in February and his father, a 59-year-old taxi driver, has seen earnings fall since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 

Dr Annabelle Chow, principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology, said the burnout a person experiences due to effects brought about by Covid-19 is a sign of pandemic fatigue. 

"This means that over time - especially if we or anyone we knew did not get Covid-19 - we are likely to be less careful or conscious about the precautions as it would appear that there is less of a need to maintain such levels of vigilance," she said. 

Long-term worries about a pandemic can take a toll on mental and emotional health and may result in the worsening of mental health conditions and chronic health problems. 

According to a Sunday Times survey of 1,000 people aged 16 and above, people in Singapore are becoming weary of the rules to limit the spread of the coronavirus. 

Dr Chow cautioned that social avoidance and distancing can make people feel isolated and lonely, and may increase stress and anxiety. 

Terri Chen, senior clinical psychologist at the National University Hospital's (NUH) Department of Psychological Medicine, said it is likely that people started feeling these effects in April when the circuit breaker here was extended. 

It may also lead to headaches, an inability to focus, digestive issues, insomnia and a weakened immune system, ultimately affecting a person's overall daily functioning.  Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist at The Therapy Room, started noticing signs of pandemic fatigue in her clients last month. 

While it is normal to drop our guard when we see no end in sight, a reminder of the benefits of maintaining precautions and the consequences of not doing so would help people stay vigilant to fight Covid-19, Chen added. 

Signs include reduced socialising with others; feeling restless, sad, helpless, unmotivated and frustrated; being irritable and sensitive; and having low mood and energy, and insomnia.  Consequently, we may begin to engage in behaviours that were initially inhibited by the anxiety responses, such as not adhering to safe distancing rules or washing our hands as regularly as we did before," she said. "

NUH's Chen said a lot of energy is required to pay attention to non-verbal communication, which is harder to pick up over video conferencing. "

HOW TO COPE WITH PANDEMIC FATIGUE
Terri Chen, head of psychology and senior clinical psychologist at the National University Hospital's department of psychological medicine, gives some tips.  These include having to wear a mask, checking in with SafeEntry, limiting the size of physical gatherings with friends and family, and not being able to travel overseas. 

People report feeling exhausted after virtual interactions, a phenomenon known as "Zoom fatigue", although it also applies to other video-conferencing platforms like Google Hangouts, Skype or FaceTime.  Although it is not classified as a mental disorder, the effects of pandemic fatigue are nevertheless real and have an impact on those experiencing it," she said. 

BE EFFECTIVE: There are many tips and suggestions on how to cope with the pandemic, such as practising mindfulness or working out, and it can be overwhelming - and tiring - to try many things at once.
