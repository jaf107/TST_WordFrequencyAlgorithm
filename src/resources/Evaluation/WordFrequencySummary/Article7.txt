 Our correspondents visited four kitchen markets and one wholesale market of the city and found that the prices of kitchen essentials like rice, onion, oil, chicken, potato and fish rose by Tk 5 to Tk 90 per kg while the prices of vegetables rose by Tk 10 to Tk 15 per kg.  While each kg of aubergine was being sold at Tk 80, a Tk 20 jump in a week, green chillies were being sold at Tk 200 per kg and local onions sold for Tk 60 to Tk 70 per kg, a hike of Tk 10 from a week ago and Tk 30 from a month ago.   
The reason for vegetable and onion price going up is understandable as acres of vegetable farms were submerged in the recent floods damaging the production and traders also blamed the insufficient import of onions for the increased price of this essential item.  But what could be the reason for the rice price hike?
