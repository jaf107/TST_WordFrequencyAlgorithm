 Autumn is seen in four different guises corresponding to the different occupations of the season autumn.  Autumn has made a conspiracy or agreement with the sun ‘to load and bless’ the vines and frees with ‘grapes and apples’, and also to ripen all fruits to the ‘core’.  So, in the first stanza autumn is seen to be an active person who is dutiful and enjoys his work very much.  A gleaner may be seen walking along steadily with the weight of grains upon her head, crossing a stream. 

Thus, throughout the poem autumn is given different personalities, related to the characteristics of this season.  Autumn, at first is seen as a woman doing the work of winnowing that is separating the chaff from the grain.  Finally, autumn is given the personality of a cider presser, who sits by the cider press and watches patiently the apple juice flowing out of the press drop by drop.  Keats has used a number of imageries to give the autumn a concrete shape of a person.  In other words, in this figure of speech inanimate objects and abstract ideas or qualities are spoken of as if they are persons or human being. How Autumn is Personified in keats' To Autumn'

Here autumn is in the form of a rural peasant woman, who is busy during the harvest.
