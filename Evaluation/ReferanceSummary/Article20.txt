How Autumn is Personified in keats' To Autumn'

In keats’ ‘To Autumn’, Autumn is personified in various human shapes. Keats has used a number of imageries to give the autumn a concrete shape of a person. The poem opens with the poet’s addressing to autumn. He addresses the season autumn in a way as if it were a living person.

Autumn has made a conspiracy or agreement with the sun ‘to load and bless’ the vines and frees with ‘grapes and apples’, and also to ripen all fruits to the ‘core’. So, in the first stanza autumn is seen to be an active person who is dutiful and enjoys his work very much. In the second stanza, autumn is however given a totally different personality. Here autumn is in the form of a rural peasant woman, who is busy during the harvest.

Autumn, at first is seen as a woman doing the work of winnowing that is separating the chaff from the grain. Giving the personality of a gleaner to autumn indicates that the harvest is almost over. Finally, autumn is given the personality of a cider presser, who sits by the cider press and watches patiently the apple juice flowing out of the press drop by drop. Thus, in the second stanza autumn is given a concrete shape and a concrete personality.

Autumn is seen in four different guises corresponding to the different occupations of the season autumn. In the last stanza the poet is seen to be also speaking with the autumn. Autumn is seen to be as an unhappy man, because he is deprived of the beauties of spring.
