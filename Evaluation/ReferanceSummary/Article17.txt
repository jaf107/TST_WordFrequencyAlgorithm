I had limited exposure to television, but BBC Radio would play in the background. My parents were fans of BBC Radio. After my SSC in 1985, my parents gifted me a National Panasonic music system. The cassette player and the radio was my portal to an imaginary world.

Just like social media is today's portal to a virtual world. Audio attracted me much more than the world of ink and paper. Thus began my journey with audio, through music and radio. The night meant you were on your own.

After studies, reading books, listening to music or following the radio was what you could do. The only option left was the audible world. If devices are the portal for the night today, for me it was my music player. I spent endless nights listening to music or the radio.

FM radio wasn't available in 1985. The radio channel was Bangladesh Betar and its different stations. World Music played between 2.30 and 3 PM on weekdays. There would be a special Yesterday Once More on Tuesdays that featured music from the 1960s and 1970s, my signature decades when it comes to music.

At night there was then and still is now, Nishuti. BBC Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4, Radio 5, and World Service all had something for every mood and every occasion. It was in my Cambridge days I realised how beautiful BBC Radio was. The Guardian, UK launched the world's first podcast in 2004.

That changed radio forever. I can escape into an imaginary world.
