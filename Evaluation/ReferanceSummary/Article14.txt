Johnson considers this as one of the great fault of Shakespeare. Shakespeare is indifferent about the distinctions of time and place, and gives to one age on manners and opinions which pertain to another. In Shakespeareâ€™s plays no distinction of time or place is observed but the customs, opinions and manners of one age or one country are freely attributed to another.
