When I first came to know of Cartoon People back in 2017, I didn't think much of them. Cartoon People are celebrating their fourth anniversary this year, and I thought of taking this opportunity to look at how far they've come, and how some of their own artists are set to make it big on a global basis. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the group, Cartoon People is a community of Bangladeshi cartoonists and visual storytellers that was founded in 2016 by cartoonist Syed Rashad Imam Tanmoy. Since its inception, Cartoon People has wholeheartedly worked to inspire like minded enthusiasts.

They've gone from being a small community of cartoon and comic enthusiasts, to taking on bigger roles to develop the art form, as well as take on other social projects. Perhaps the most inspiring part of Cartoon People's journey till now is how it showcased talent. Many cartoonists and artists from this community are now doing quite well for themselves. Some of my personal favourites from Cartoon People include The Bathroom Artist by Walker Bin Zaman, Gorib Anju by Tamim Anju, Tiborai er Cartoon by Chandrika Nurani Irabotee, Peu Draws by Debadrita Peu, Tube Light by Tuba Anjum, and Shesh Raater Shopno by Ayman Aswaf.

The thing about these artists is the variation in their work, and their ability to say so much through their stories and characters. In their four-year journey, Cartoon People have indeed come a long way, and they aren't going to stop.
