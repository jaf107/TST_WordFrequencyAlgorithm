Back when I was in fourth grade, my friends and I heard (and believed) rumours that an old zamindar house, located just beside our school, harboured the evil spirit of a dead woman.
 Sometimes when playing cricket, when the ball would end up in that zamindar house, no one would dare to go to that house to fetch it.
 The aforementioned incident is an ideal example of rumour, in which information was the presence of an evil spirit in the house.
 That information circulated among the students of our school.
 It was instrumentally relevant, because it impacted our lives as sometimes our tennis balls would end up in that house.


Rumours circulate via discussion between people, especially when the uncertainty breeds anxiety among them.
 The rumours which tend to affect the social status of people or which are personally relevant to them spread like wildfires as these can boost self-esteem or serve the egos of people.


Rumours can be both positive and negative.
 Negative rumours, especially the ones intended to harm or sully a person or an organisation's reputation can impact our attitudes and behaviours towards them.
 On the other hand, positive rumours about a person inadvertently encourage us to focus on their positive values, which results in better impressions and we are quick to put our trust in that person, often to our own detriment.
