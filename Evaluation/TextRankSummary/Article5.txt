Can night owls lead a healthy life?
Being a night owl, it was always normal for me to stay awake until 3 AM and wake up early to catch the 7 AM bus to attend my 8 AM class.

But ever since the university closed due to the pandemic, I stopped sleeping at night entirely and started going to bed early in the morning, thinking that getting plenty of sleep during the day would allow me to continue leading a healthy life.

To my shock, I found from a study that mistimed sleep, such as sleeping during the day may disrupt and alter the rhythms of our gene activities (Archer et al.
 Therefore, pulling all-nighters and sleeping during the day is not a good choice, even more so if it's continued for a prolonged period of time.

However, sleep deprivation, a common phenomenon among night owls, is actually more detrimental than sleeping during the day.
 Researchers have uncovered evidence indicating that individuals who go to sleep very late and in turn wake up very late tend to have lower brain connectivity and therefore, they are more prone to attention deficit, slower reaction time and increased sleepiness during working hours (Facer-Childs et al.
 The traditional 9 to 5 working hours can be tough for the night owl, because the sleep deficit may result in diminished performance during the morning.
 Night owls have also been found to be risk takers and researchers have found no significant difference in overall performance between night owls and early birds.
 So, adjusting the sleep routine and maintaining a healthy diet can help night owls to lead a healthy life.
