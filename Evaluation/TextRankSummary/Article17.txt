 I had limited exposure to television, but BBC Radio would play in the background.
 My parents were fans of BBC Radio.


The first twist came when we returned to Bangladesh in 1979.


After my SSC in 1985, my parents gifted me a National Panasonic music system.
 The cassette player and the radio was my portal to an imaginary world.
 Just like social media is today's portal to a virtual world.
 Audio attracted me much more than the world of ink and paper.
 Thus began my journey with audio, through music and radio.
 After studies, reading books, listening to music or following the radio was what you could do.
 I was never a voracious reader.


If devices are the portal for the night today, for me it was my music player.
 I spent endless nights listening to music or the radio.


The radio channel was Bangladesh Betar (then Radio Bangladesh) and its different stations.
 World Music played between 2.


At night there was then and still is now, Nishuti.
 Nishuti played till almost 3 AM.


Short wave was my passport to the outside world.
 BBC World Service, Voice of America, All India Radio, Radio Ceylon, Radio Luxembourg, Australian Broadcasting; the list goes on.

My love for radio resurfaced during my youth when I was studying at Cambridge.
 BBC Radio 2, Radio 3, Radio 4, Radio 5, and World Service all had something for every mood and every occasion.
 It was in my Cambridge days I realised how beautiful BBC Radio was.
 Radio was ripe for a transformation.
 That changed radio forever.
 I'm not a voracious reader.
 Why do I love radio so much? I can close my eyes and concentrate.
 I can escape into an imaginary world.
