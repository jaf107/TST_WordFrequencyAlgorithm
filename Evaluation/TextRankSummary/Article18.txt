 I always thought of reading as something I did out of love.
 Ever since I was a little girl, I would get two or three books a month, and I'd voraciously read through every word, remembering everything to my heart's content.
 That is when I came across the concept of reading goals, and it was almost as if I was never a reader at all, a thought that hit hard given I always thought of myself as a good reader, if nothing else.
 It wasn't till a year and half passed that I realised that even though I had read more books in those months than ever, I had retained the least.
 I had fallen for the concept of reading goals, to only grow to detest it.


I find reading goals a redundant effort if the aim is to get into reading.
 It is better to read a book every month and be able to retain the contents for long than to read five books a month and wonder what they were even about after a year.


I have seen readers who were simply in love with reading become unhealthily obsessed with the concept of reading.
 Again, not reaching reading goals can be discouraging and may dishearten the reader entirely.
 As a reader, one should not feel inadequate for having read fewer books than another person.


There is no denying that there are readers who can readily extract said pleasure even through reading goals, but I find it rather counterproductive and diminutive when it comes to attaining the actual essence of reading.
