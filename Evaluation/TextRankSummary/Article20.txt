How Autumn is Personified in keats' To Autumn'
Personification is a figure of speech in which the attributes of a person are transferred to inanimate objects or abstract ideas.
In other words, in this figure of speech inanimate objects and abstract ideas or qualities are spoken of as if they are persons or human being.
Keats has used a number of imageries to give the autumn a concrete shape of a person.
The autumn and the sun are given the human power of making friendship.
So, in the first stanza autumn is seen to be an active person who is dutiful and enjoys his work very much.
In the second stanza, autumn is however given a totally different personality.
Autumn, at first is seen as a woman doing the work of winnowing that is separating the chaff from the grain.
Thirdly, autumn is personified as a gleaner.
A gleaner is a woman who collects grains from the field when the crops have been removed.
Giving the personality of a gleaner to autumn indicates that the harvest is almost over.
Thus, in the second stanza autumn is given a concrete shape and a concrete personality.
Autumn is seen in four different guises corresponding to the different occupations of the season autumn.
In the last stanza the poet is seen to be also speaking with the autumn.
Thus, throughout the poem autumn is given different personalities, related to the characteristics of this season.
