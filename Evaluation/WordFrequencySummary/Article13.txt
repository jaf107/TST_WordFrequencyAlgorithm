In this kind of poem a single person, who is apparently not the poet, utters the entire poem in a specific situation at a critical moment.  Tennyson like another Victorian genius Robert Browing is good at composing dramatic monologues. 

Ulysses has become old but it is the knowledge and experience which he has gathered so long urges him on even in the old age to sail in quest of knowledge. A dramatic monologue is a lyric poem in which a single imaginary speaker or a historical personage expresses his thoughts and feelings to an imaginary silent audience.  Just a man drinks till he has reached the sediment at the bottom, Ulysses also will taste all aspects of life without leaving anything behind. 

Ulysses knows that he and his sailors, being old are nearer death, but he has not given up hope and believes that old men also can earn great glory and achieve great deeds. 

This person addresses and interacts with one or more other people, but we know of the presence of the audience and its reaction from the clues in the utterance of the speaker.  Every word Uttered by Ulysses helps to constitute the idea that life is short and knowledge is unlimited, so we must not stop from pursuing knowledge.  His portrayal of the character Ulysses deserves huge appreciation for there is a consonantal movement of thought, pervading the character Ulysses from beginning to the end.  His ‘My Last Duchess,” Andrea del Sarto,” ‘Fra Lippo Lippi’, Tennyson’s ‘Ulysses’ and ‘Tittonus,” T. 

But the monologue of Ulysses reaches to the point of climax, when he inspires his sailors and makes on appeal to them to enter upon a life of exploration with great courage. 

Here by the word ‘travel’ he means the journey which he made to rescue Helen from Paris and the perilous journey after the destruction of Troy.  

It little profits that an idle king
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
That hoard and steep and feed and know not me. 

Ulysses, the man of nimble wit, is not satisfied with his life among his subjects, who are unaware of his heroic mould.  His well known poem Ulysses is an excellent example of dramatic monologue in which he adopts a classical hero Ulysses or Odysseus as the main character for his work.  So, he inspires his sailors to achieve some great deeds even in their old age before thy die.  He is standing before the royal palace of Ithaca and speaks before the mariners, who had been his fellow sojourners during his long journey to Troy.  Just a sword losses its polish and gets rusty when if is kept out of use for longtime, so also vigor and energy will be dulled and blunted if we do not exercise then always.  He reminds then that everyone of them is brave and strong willed, everyone of them knows how to labor, how to struggle hard and how to pursue a great aim.  Everyone of them will tough out any bad situation and never bow his head before hardships or troubles.  He is perfectly aware that knowledge is vast and unlimited and our life on earth is too short to learn everything.  He knows that even old age cannot rob great men of their courage, bravery and other spiritual qualities.
