# Text Summarization Tool

This repository contains a Text Summarization Tool implemented in Java using the following extractive approaches:

1. Word Frequency Algorithm
2. Text Rank Algorithm
3. Direct Method Algorithm

## Introduction

Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text while preserving its key information. This tool provides three different algorithms to perform extractive text summarization, which means it selects the most important sentences from the original text to form the summary.

## How It Works

1. **Word Frequency Algorithm:**
   This approach ranks sentences based on the frequency of important words in each sentence. The sentences with higher frequencies of essential words are considered more relevant and are included in the summary.

2. **Text Rank Algorithm:**
   Inspired by the PageRank algorithm used by Google, Text Rank treats each sentence as a node in a graph. The algorithm evaluates the importance of sentences by considering the relationships between them, and the most significant sentences are selected to form the summary.

3. **Direct Method Algorithm:**
   The Direct Method Algorithm uses a scoring function to rank sentences. The scores are calculated based on different features, such as sentence length, position in the text, and keyword frequency. The top-scoring sentences are chosen for the summary.

## How to Use the Tool

To use the Text Summarization Tool, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/jaf107/text-summarization-tool.git
```

2. Open the Java project in your preferred IDE.

3. Run the main program, providing the input text that you want to summarize.

4. The program will process the input text using the three extractive summarization algorithms.

5. Finally, the program will display the summaries generated by each algorithm, allowing you to compare the results.
